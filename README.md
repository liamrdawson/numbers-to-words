# **numbers**
create a small application that will convert numbers from 1 to 100,000 into words. It will need to include all punctuation and conjunctions.

The application will need to allow the user to input a range (start and end). If no range is provided, it should output the entire range above (1 to 100,000,000 in words)
 
Example use case:

The user enters a start “1000” and an end of “2222”.
    
The application will then output that range in words. For example:

        One thousand
        One thousand and one
        One thousand and two
        … etc.
        … etc.
        Two thousand, 
        two hundred and twenty two

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
