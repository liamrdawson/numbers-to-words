# **TO DO** 

- [ ] Create a function that receives two integers as arguments.

- [ ] Create an input for the numbers.

- [ ] Create an output for the numbers.

    ### How will this be structured?

- [ ] Set up an array for each unit, e.g. ones, teens, hundreds, etc

- [ ] Use functional programming techniques by separating the logic into functions for specific units, e.g. convertHundreds, convertThousands. 

    - Maybe you can make each unit function take the value of its child, e.g convertThousands fuction can contain convertHundreds value and convertTens

- [ ] convertOnes
- [ ] convertTens
- [ ] convertHundreds
- [ ] convertThousands
